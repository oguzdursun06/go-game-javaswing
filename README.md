# Go game using Java Swing.
 A kind of go game with different rules. As the rule of the game, if black stones are surrounded by whites, they will be white. This is also true for black. Stones have the right to pass. But if the good player passes consecutively, the game is over, and the one with the higher score wins the game. If the scores are the same, there is a draw.
